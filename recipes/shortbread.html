        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white rice flour</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>325 degrees F (165 degrees C)</strong>. </li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with greaseproof (parchment) paper. Sift the flour and rice flour into a medium mixing bowl. Add the sugar and mix.</li>
